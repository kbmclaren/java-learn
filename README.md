# java-learn

## Code Academy

  This repo holds the code I developed while studying Java under the direction of the CodeAcademy course "Java for Programmers". 
  Why CodeAcademy? Because the subscription fee bugs me enough to regulary return to learn the new language even though I hate toy programming 
  exercises like the ones in this repo. 
  
## Authorship

  Some code in this repo is copy-pasta from CodeAcademy's course. I just want to see Java work on my computer.
  
  The code in the codeChallenge file(s) is mostly original code but the simplicity of the problems almost guarantees that there will be occasional
  overlap of solution structure. I'm not making this repo in order to showcase novel/original problem solving solutions, I'm learning the fundamentals 
  of Java and I'm NOT trying to spend a lot of time doing so.
  
## Intent of Repo

  Finally, creating this repo is about using source/version control tools and documenting my effort to learn a broadly used language like Java.
  Also, being active on Github looks better to me than the alternative, so I am trying to regulary upload code to my profile.
